# TIOBE index

Indice che calcola la popolarit√† dei linguaggi di programmazione

## TIOBE Programming Community Index Definition

Since there are many questions about the way the TIOBE index is assembled, a special page is devoted to its definition. 
Basically the calculation comes down to counting hits for the search query

`+"<language> programming"`

## Programming Language

In this section it is clarified what counts as a programming language for the TIOBE index. There are 3 requirements that should all hold:

    The language should have an own entry on Wikipedia and Wikipedia should clearly state that it concerns a programming language. This is the reason why (Ruby on) Rails, Excel, Android, Boost, Cocoa, ASP and AJAX are not considered programming languages for the index.
    The programming language should be Turing complete. As a consequence, HTML and XML are not considered programming languages.
    The programming language should have at least 5,000 hits for +"<language> programming" for Google.

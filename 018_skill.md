### code organization across files

* No thought given to organizing code across files
* Related files are grouped into a folder

### source tree organization

* Everything in one folder
* Basic separation of code into logical folders.

### code readability

* Mono-syllable names
* Good names for files, variables classes, methods etc.
* No long functions, comments explaining unusual code, bug fixes, code assumptions
* Code assumptions are verified using asserts, code flows naturally – no deep nesting of conditionals or methods

### defensive coding

* Doesn’t understand the concept
* Checks all arguments and asserts critical assumptions in code
* Makes sure to check return values and check for exceptions around code that can fail.
* Has his own library to help with defensive coding, writes unit tests that simulate faults


### error handling

* Only codes the happy case
* Basic error handling around code that can throw exceptions/generate errors
* Ensures that error/exceptions leave program in good state, resources, connections and memory is all cleaned up properly
* Codes to detect possible exception before, maintain consistent exception handling strategy in all layers of code, come up with guidelines on exception handling for entire system.

### IDE
